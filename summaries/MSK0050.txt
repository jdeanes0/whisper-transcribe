**SUBJECTIVE:** The patient, a graduate student residing in a downtown rented basement apartment with their boyfriend, presented with a chief complaint of gradual onset of numbness in the right hand over the past month or two. The numbness is most pronounced in the thumb and index finger, with mild symptoms extending to the middle and ring fingers. Activities like driving, using a phone, and holding objects exacerbate the symptoms, with difficulty in grip leading to dropping items. The patient describes the sensation as tingling rather than pain and reports no radiating symptoms or associated neck pain. There is a history of childhood asthma, but no current use of inhalers, and denies any recent weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, changes in vision, hearing, or other senses, respiratory symptoms, chest pain, abdominal issues, joint pain, or skin changes.
