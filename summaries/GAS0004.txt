Assessment:
The patient is presenting with a gastrointestinal issue characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, and intermittent nausea over the past few days. There may be an infectious or food-related etiology, considering the symptom onset after dining at a new restaurant five days prior.

Plan:
1. Recommend continued hydration with clear fluids to prevent dehydration.
2. Suggest continuation of bismuth subsalicylate for symptom relief.
3. Advise the patient to monitor and report any changes in symptoms, especially concerning vomiting and cramping.
4. Consider further evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen, such as stool studies or imaging studies.
