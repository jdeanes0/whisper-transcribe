1. Initiate antibiotic treatment prophylactically given the duration of tick attachment.
2. Consult with the physician to discuss the necessity of antibiotic therapy and further diagnostic steps.
3. Consider sending the tick for species identification to determine potential Lyme disease risk.
4. Evaluate the need for blood work to assess for Lyme disease titers or serology.
5. Advise the patient to monitor for any signs of infection or illness and follow up if any new symptoms develop.
