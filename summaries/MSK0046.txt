Assessment:
The provider mentioned the possibility of De Quervain's tenosynovitis due to the patient's symptoms and repetitive hand use. Further evaluation to rule out other conditions like early osteoarthritis was suggested. The initial management plan includes wearing a splint for immobilization, conservative measures to reduce symptoms, potential corticosteroid injection if conservative methods fail, and monitoring for improvement over time.

Plan:
1. Wear a thumb splint for immobilization.
2. Implement conservative measures to alleviate symptoms.
3. Consider corticosteroid injection if conservative treatment is ineffective.
4. Monitor response to treatment and adjust the management plan accordingly.
